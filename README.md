# crito2
Crito was a project started in 2018-2019 and was written as an all in one OSINT tool. Its a project that isnt dead but also isnt kept very active as tech has advanced far beyond what it was at the time. This is however a great starting point for new programmers who want to get into OSINT programming and develop tools and get the general gist of how these tools can be implemented.
